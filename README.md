# DIY Web Services

Imagine AWS/GCP on your own hardware. This is that.

DIYWS provides a remote-monitoring and management interface for Docker, so you can easily host software on your old laptop in the corner.

## Resource Usage

DIYWS is designed to be lightweight. This does occasionally come at the expense of speed. It consumes ~150 MB of RAM and uses ~0.1% CPU (on a M4 Pro chip).
